# Frontend Mentor - Article preview component

This is a solution to the [Article preview component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/article-preview-component-gvY1W_PRX). 

## Overview
The project is currently in the **Design Phase**. The layout is complete, and the focus is now moving toward interactivity.

### The challenge
Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size.
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon (JS functionality pending).

## My process
### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Tailwind
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Current Status
- [x] HTML Structure
- [x] Responsive CSS Design
- [ ] JavaScript Toggle Functionality

## Continued development
My next step is to implement the JavaScript logic to handle the state of the share tooltip. I plan to use a simple class toggle to manage the visibility of the social links.
